Relying on the motives modue, it is avaliable as a standalone desktop application, built with the popular electron framework.
One of the cool things here is that electron brdiges the gab between clientside web application and the user's filesystem.

The **motives** module allows to create and maintain a number of connected associative mindsets which you can san by fulltext and tag search.
But you can also link files or information, be it a file for a text editor, a presentation or a web research.

If you click on it, the respective file will be launched (in your text editor, presentation program or favorite browser).

So basically it is a tool that lets you manage great amount of i9nformation, perfect for a writer who takes care of a lot of characters. 
But it could be also useful for academics and researchers - anybody in need of a mtea adminstration tool.
